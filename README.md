# Predicting-COVID-19-Infection-with-Random-Forest-in-R

This project applies machine learning and statistical analysis to detect COVID-19 using blood sample data. It preprocesses key blood parameters and implements a Random Forest model in R to classify whether a person is infected. By analyzing patterns in the dataset, this approach aids in improving diagnostic accuracy and early detection.
